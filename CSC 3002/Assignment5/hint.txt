In Problem 2, the destruction problem may make your program crash. If you encounter this issue, you have the following 2 choices.

(1) Directly comment out the destructor function and don't use it in your program. It is an easy way but a few points (at most 0.5 points) will be deducted from your grade.

(2) Alternatively, the destructor function is encouraged to implement, which is a bit challenging but very interesting.

If you meet difficulties in problem 2, there are some tips for you to check your code: 

(3). Pay attention to the difference between "return by value" and "return by reference".

(4). Pay attention to the difference between "shallow copy" and "deep copy".

(5). Pay attention to the function of "operator=" where the default operation is a shallow copy.
